I am a researcher (Chargée de Recherche) at the Physics Lab of L'École Normale Supérieure (ENS) de Lyon, affiliated with CNRS.

My scientific interests lie at the intersection of physics, chemistry, and biology. I was trained as a computational physicist with a specialization in polymers and soft matter, and I apply this expertise to biological systems. Specifically, I study the phase-related properties of intrinsically disordered proteins—proteins that do not have a fixed three-dimensional structure. These proteins play a crucial role in physiological processes and are implicated in pathological aggregations. Additionally, I contribute to the development of integrative modeling approaches for biological systems, including protein complexes and disordered proteins.
